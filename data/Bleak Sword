Luis Jimenez, the developer behind Bleak Sword, advises to stop trying to replicate a gamepad in a touch screen, because without the physical feedback of the buttons and sticks it will never feel the same. Try to come up with creative ways of control using just the touch language.

Come up with enemy behaviors and actions, then mix and match them based on suitability. Making enemies environmentally aware when possible, and mixing enemies with complementary behaviors to appear together can create more strategic behaviour in players.
