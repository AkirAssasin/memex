## Subtraction
As you simplify and add space to your design you emphasize what remains. 
Space surrounding graphics, margins and paddings, columns...

## Similarity
Similarity in design creates structure.
Objects that look similar, enclosed together, near to each other, or arranged in a line are percieved as similar. You can explain each element's purpose in a way that feels intuitive.
Place labels closest to the relevant fields.

## Focus
Bring the information into a space a user focuses most on, and reduce eye travel to fetch information while retaining legibility.

Elements are percieved as either figures (objects of focus) or grounds (background). Add a 5-10px Gaussian blur on a screenshot and see which elements stand out. 
 
Use color and weight to create hierarchy instead of size. Light/dark contrast creates an impression of depth, and attract users to light objects. Warm colors tend to dominate cool colors.

Every action on a page sits somewhere in a pyramid of importance. Most pages only have one true primary action. Itâ€™s important to communicate their place in the hierarchy through design.

## Color Theory
Contrast: the color on the opposite end of the wheel
Complement: colors immediately next to it on the wheel
Triadic: any 3 colors located 120 degrees from each other
Split complementary: 2 contrasting and complementing pairs
Analogous: 3 complementing colors

## Audio Cues
Audio cues must be distinct and clear enough to convey information, and sometimes can be used to replace visual elements.

## Game Misc.
Hide elements that are not necessary, revealing them when needed with snappy and responsive animations.
Integrate the HUD in a way that feels like part of the game instead of an additional layer cluttering the screen. This maintains player immersion without sacrificing functionality of HUDs.
