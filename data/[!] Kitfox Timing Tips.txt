Don’t launch or publicize anything during or just before or after a big thing happens. This includes big press events and title launches. If a surprise news occurs, delay your upcoming email to the day after. The press will need time to report on reviews, trends, controversies AND recover from exhaustion.

Emails are most likely to be read on Tuesday, Wednesday, & Thursday. Don't expect any replies during holidays.

Give 1–2 weeks warning if press needs to write/record something new (review, interview, etc), and 3–5 days if they can basically copy/paste a video link. Be sure to include a time of day.

The typical process goes like this:
Game release > Game announce/reveal > Crowdfund succeeds > New trailer > Crowdfund launches.
People only love success :(

The more immediate your game is, the more exciting it is to cover. So maybe don’t announce a date at all, if it’s forever away.

Don’t launch the same month as a game that is in your genre/aesthetic/target audience. Don't launch a game during a platform (like Steam) sale!
