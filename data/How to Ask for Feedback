Always have a clear end goal in mind when asking for feedback, and articulate that clearly to the person. What do you really want to get out of the exchange?

By knowing what you want out of the feedback, you can figure out the right group of people to listen to. Different aspects of your product will require feedback from people with different expertise.

If you really need feedback from someone, never give up until you get it. Be like a good salesperson.

Make your questions be as neutral and specific as possible. Try to answer your own questions to see if they are effective. If your question seems too broad, break it up into smaller questions.

When receiving feedback, make sure your mind is calm and clear. Don't let emotions cloud your interpretation. Take time to think through what people are telling you. Discuss this with them in the moment. Clarify and verify the feedback.
