One of the most powerful ways of making choices interesting is to make them meaningful: touching values, emotions, concepts that people care about.

The first thing we need to consider is player motivation. 
Presenting the player with an outside goal to “beat the game” gives external motivation. 
Building worlds players want to spend time in, allowing players to roleplay their “ideal self” gives internal motivation.

Conflict between player motivations create tension. 
It is different from conflict between gameplay and narration (usually a bad thing).

Clash 'optimum' playstyles with moral dilemmas. The external, goal-oriented motivation told you to steal. The narrative, internal motivation told you not to. This tends to generating a meaningful, difficult decision. However, make sure none of the choices leads to an inferior gameplay experience.
