A method to generate organic platforming rooms:

Generate some tiles in each corner of the room in a roughly concave manner, then mold the emptier parts of the room with some convex shapes.

Next, generate a random amount of floating shapes around the room. Let them overlap if it happens.

Make sure the player can reach every exit, then check that the player can make every jump. Generate some steps to help players with impossible jumps.

Keep it clean and coherent.
