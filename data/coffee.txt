Ambience is an important aspect in a game that allows players to be fully immersed into the experience. 

There are various ways you can craft your atmosphere - color, nostalgia / familiarity and audio.

Skeuomorphism is a design of a virtual object that inherits the physical appearance of their real-world counterparts. A minimalistic, practical, efficient interface can sometimes break the immersion of the game experience.

Contrast, brightness and hover effects matter when players are trying to determine the interactivity of an object.

You can create a diverse character cast based on established personality indicators or alignment charts like The Myers Briggs Type Indicator Scale.
