Devil May Cry 5 is a “good-feeling” game according to director Hideaki Itsuno. 
A good-feeling game responds in a way that the player expects. When you press a button, there should be a clear result - visual and audio. Convey every sense of impact and character where there is one. 

To help accommodate players, Devil May Cry 5 works hard to make sure that success and failure aren’t binary states. Even if players mistime their button press, they can still get some charge for their next attack.
