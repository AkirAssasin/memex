The greater the player's situational awareness, the lower the difficulty. By changing this factor, difficulty can be varied between levels.

Low situational awareness (e.g. flashlight in a dark room) can make small spaces seem larger, increase caution and promote exploration.

Consider that the size of a game space is always filtered through the camera; hence, in terms of a hierarchy of difficulty metrics, virtual space will always be secondary.

The more correction cycles the player is forced to undertake, the higher the difficulty.

In FPSes, it seems that world movement change is preferred above excessive view frustum changes. In most cases, a player will choose to backpedal first with minimal changes to view position.
