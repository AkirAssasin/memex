Ian Condry interviewed m&k, a character design team.

They developed the characters by drawing up a wide range and selecting from them. They looked for those who were in some way unbalanced.

Instead of starting from a visual image, they thought in terms of a distinctive flavor or skill. They emphasized the extreme. Each character is defined by a simple concept. Though simplistic, each character feels likable and real.

Characters in some games don't need traditional character development. You just need to convey an impression of who they are in totality. The world is usually what develops.

Assign a short, simple theme to your game to help provide structure and consistency.

it is dangerous to thoughtlessly include something because each object changes the user's understanding of and response to the game.
