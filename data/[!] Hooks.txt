Surface level strategies to capture a player's interest and HOOK them in.

There are different kinds of hooks - art, trailer, description, music. Your hook should elicit a strong reaction. Find the one most suitable for the game and its audience.

If your hook is indistinguishable when you remove your game name from it, then you need a better hook.

If you need some help, take out everything you would usually use to describe your game and try to describe it again WITHOUT THOSE WORDS.

The hook itself should be more emotional than factual. It serves to keep the person's attention long enough to read/listen the rest of the pitch. After the hook, follow up with answers to the questions raised from the hook.
