Make games that can be understood at a glance. A picture is worth a thousand words, but only if the picture makes sense.

It makes implementing your tutorials less work. When your game is good at teaching onlookers to play, it'll draw in more viewers. 

This may be the result of good information organization and UI design.

Design your interface based on The Three Reads.
The first read pulls you in, and that's the core of your game.
The second read fills in key details, or big unintuitive rules.
The third read gives you contextually important information.

Good design shows you things in the right order. 
You can use movement and animation to temporarily raise or lower the read of a game component. Animating something instead of having it pop in can reinforce its importance. Hide information that are not important at the moment.
