When creating your gameâ€™s narrative, get to the point as quickly as possible.

## Character

You don't need to develop a story-heavy game to create characters that people can get very deeply invested in. 

Set up a strong theme for each character as you design them. It helps you convey and tie the character together.

The reactions of a character to an event (the catalyst) shows their personality.

A strong and clear change in a character can be compelling on its own.

Enviroments should have a character of their own.

## In-Game Literature

When writing in-game literature, know the purpose, author and genre.
