How the developers of Splatoon used the objective (to paint the map) and other tricks to encourage players to move?

To cover the map in your paint, players have to move to find every nook and cranny to cover in paint. Sitting and waiting in Splatoon 2 ensures that you will lose the match. Moving to the center of the map, where games are won and lost, is of the utmost importance.

Players must go into the squid form and swim in your coloured paint to regain ammo. You will need to create a path for yourself. To travel the fastest and cover the map to win the game you will need to shoot out your path.  

Your squid form also allows you to swim up painted walls, opening up the map to new traversal possibilities.
