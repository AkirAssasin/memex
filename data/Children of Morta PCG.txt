How are the levels in Children of Morta generated?

Parameters define the rooms and constraints on how different types of rooms can be connected together. A graph is then generated. Additional, narrative or quest related rooms are then added onto the graph. Quests or narrative developments could resolve in a single level, or unfold across levels.

Each room has a number of possible shapes and forms, so there’s a lot of different possibilities for connecting them according to the graph.

Once the rooms are placed, it’s time to fill them up. Doors and connections between rooms. Narrative assets and cutscenes. Pathfinding. Enemies. Loot.

By keeping track of the player’s progress, they can apply dynamic difficulty, unlocking new content at the right time, and analyse player behaviour.
