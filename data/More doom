2016’s Doom is designed to be played one specific way. It punishes passivity in favor of aggression. The guns are the tool, the AI is the problem, and the solution to those problems is to be aggressive. Need something? Kill demons. 

“When you’re thinking, you’re engaged.” In Doom, the player is constantly engaged with split-second decisions. 

Players can learn from losses when they can understand what they did wrong, and this makes them want to get back into the game.
