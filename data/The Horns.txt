In The Horns, all player decisions came down to one question: will you risk X to get Y? The process of making the game consisted of looking at the various possible "tradeoffs" and making them into interesting pieces of narrative.

Each chapter's narrative is made from randomized cards. Every single cards is tagged with its 'trade' type - what X to exchange with what Y. The probabilities of each card is then affected by what type of and how much resources the player has.

Try to identify the smallest number of things necessary to convey a specific atmosphere.
