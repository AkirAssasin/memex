Score systems have been relied on by all kinds of interactive systems designers to make a game a little bit more replayable, challenging and competitive.

Completion systems have just two states: completed, or not completed. Winning is just a tiny notch in the long life of a usually highly replayable system.

High score systems output a number at the end of play that reflects the player's ability.

Score test systems determine outcome based on whether the player reaches a score threshold.
