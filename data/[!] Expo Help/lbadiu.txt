Drop the mindset that you're any less than others just because you're a student. As much as being a student can hinder some of your experiences, it can be a very useful crutch to lean on. Some people are willing to take out of their day to mentor students.

Find people who you'll be interested in meeting up with before the event, and ask if they'd be interested.

Go to event parties that aren't in a loud venue so you can meet new people, but try to avoid drinking.

Following up is an important step in networking. A simple "Hey it was great meeting you" not only helps remind someone else of your conversation but also of who you are and shows you actually paid attention to them.
