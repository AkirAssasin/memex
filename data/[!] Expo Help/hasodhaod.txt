Before a showcase, set objectives. 

People tend to ignore or throw away flyers unless they has some value in themselves. 

Write down some info about contacts right after meeting them so you remember who they are and what they do.

Make sure you have the whole trip planned. 

Hide placeholders.

People don't usually spend a long time, so they might miss out on many of the features. 

Have a fail-safe for when people get stuck.

Branding!
