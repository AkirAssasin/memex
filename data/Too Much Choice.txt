With every new option/choice added, your game will gain a degree of player engagement, but possibly at the cost of making the game more time-consuming, complex or repetitive. 

More options can lead to more indecision.

Complexity can narrow down the potential audience of the game. The success of MOBAs demonstrate that players enjoy the thrill of RTS games but not necessarily the intense demands of managing every unit. 

Games with too much freedom can become repetitive, as players often stick to a set of favorite or most viable choices.
