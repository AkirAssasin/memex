There's a lot of options available to indie developers for music. Free, royalty free, commissions and licensing existing music.

It is easier to license music from indie artists or small label companies. Find who you need to contact and send a licensing request. The message should be short, precise and professional.

After reading your first message, the copyright holder should know:

What you want
Who you are
What you're making
What is the next step if interested

While some artists may want to use their own contracts, most will expect you to provide it, so it's a good idea to prepare one before contacting them. The contract should include:

Your name and address
The copyright holder name and address
Is the usage exclusive or not
The territory covered
The time covered
The name of the song concerned
A description of all allowed use for the song
Who own the right to the song and how credit should be handled
The payment and royalties
Signature and dates

The best thing to do is always to hire a lawyer to write one for you.

Evaluate each negotiation and if you agree, send a new modified contract. If you can't agree to their demands, write a polite email back explaining your position and make a counter-offer if possible. Stay professional and never play the 'poor indie' card.

Give yourself enough time to find all the songs you want - it can be a long process.
