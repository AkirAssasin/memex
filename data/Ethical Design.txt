Addiction is a disorder. The games industry tends to use the term "addiction" too lightly. Some people are addicted to games, but you can't say that games are creating addiction.

If your game is successful and a lot of people are playing it, maybe you can think about how you can reward breaks, and reduce the fear of missing out. 

For example, If you come back after a rest, you get XP multipliers in World of Warcraft. In Animal Crossing, at some point there's nothing else to do in the game, and you have to wait a little and come back.

If your game is targeting kids, you have to think about it even more deeply. Itâ€™s much harder for kids to rationalize against the fear of missing out.

Some possible ethical changes in monetization include using a Battle Pass model, or capping spending for certain audiences.
