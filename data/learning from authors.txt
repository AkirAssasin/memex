Here is what indie authors are doing that we should consider:

They build a loyal fan base. Indie authors make their real money from repeat buyers. A mailing list outperforms Twitter and Facebook, and allows authors to converse 1 on 1 with their fans, slowly establishing a relationship.

To get people on their mailing list, authors typically have a book on Amazon that is discounted to free or $0.99. That cheap book ends on a cliff hanger, but signing up for the mailing list gives them the sequel for free.  

These folks crank out books frequently. On top of books they also write regular blog posts, short stories, and emails to their fans. Nobody knows which will be a hit so they just need to keep trying. Also if you write more, there are more books for your fans to buy.

Quality is important but there are other ways to do more faster. Cut details that nobody is going to care about. Reuse code between games. Just release. Don't add new ideas mid-project.

Indies rarely make sequels. There is a good chance that players who discover you because of one sequel will go back and download your previous games. Make sure that your promotional materials look like they are part of a set.

Indie authors long ago noticed that if they try and push the boundaries and blend established genres their sales suffer. They also make sure that their book covers contain a very complex yet subtle set of symbology to accurately signal to readers which sub genre this book belongs to.

Consider sticking to a genre for several games. A high percentage of the people who download your game do it because they like that genre not because they like you. It is more expensive to acquire new customers than it is to contact an existing one.

The indie book community is just as close as the indie game community. However, they take their comradery a step further and do many co-marketing strategies. Even if the authors do not have a bundle together, they do make agreements to promote each otherâ€™s books.
