We scroll to interact everywhere. When scrolling, you either go up or down. This makes it almost effortless to operate in contrast with clicking, which requires greater deliberation and decision.

Allow rapid, incremental, reversible scrolling, sensitive to magnitude. Provide instantaneous, consistent feedback. Have visual feedback when the user reaches the top or bottom to increase responsiveness.

Make it predictable and easy to control!
