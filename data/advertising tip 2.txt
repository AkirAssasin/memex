There is still plenty of room for games that are marketed properly to be noticed. You just have to know what you're doing, or hire someone who does.

That thing you think is cool about your game? It's probably not the main thing that will make people care. Elements of your game that makes it really interesting needs something else to latch onto first. Market with the hook, not the kicker.

Your trailers need to immediately explain to players what the game is about.

Most people don't actually read video game news, including people who play video games. However, those outside of the video game bubble might read news and have interests elsewhere that you can still connect with. Do you have a hook that could connect you with an entirely different audience?

Have a way to bring together the people who like what they see in your game.

Don't announce something then disappear off to work on it. This makes your announcement pointless, because everyone who saw the news at first probably forgot about it by the time you come back into their lives.
