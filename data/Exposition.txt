1. What is The Story About?
Be clear on the leitmotif, core, key pillars of your story. Everything rotates around it, everything is contextualized by it. The rest is for side quests.

2. Exposition Management
You have to present enough information for the player to continue the game, but not too much so that a player isn’t overwhelmed or bored.

3. Exposition Value
Present only the crucial information on the right occasion, to reinforce the spine of the story.

4. Dedicated Segments
Have dedicated segments for each part of the story. It will be more impactful because there is nothing else distracting the player from the part you're showing.

5. Know Your Players
Know the tropes your players are well-versed with, so you know what you don't need to repeat.

6. Repeat
Don’t assume your players will get all of your cleverly laid exposition. Drive the point down in multiple ways if it's that important.

7. Stealthy Exposition
You can sneak your exposition in minutiae details, into actions.

8. Twists
Twists can pave the way for more exposition to follow.

9. Branching Scenarios
If you have branching scenarios / dialogues then you can hide different expositions in the various choices.

10. Osmosis
Make exposition stand out, but don’t call attention to it. Repeat names and facts, but don’t shove them in the players' faces.
