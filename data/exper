An experience is something that we move through, interact with, that we help to shape, and that shapes us. Here are some of the reasons why experiences may be poorly designed:

- insufficient resources
- design isn't prioritized
- existing limitations or rigidity
- manipulative or hostile intentions
- outdated concepts that are not updated
- catered to specific groups, or an imagined average
- tunnel vision

Here are a few examples of how one might design a pleasant experience:

- sense of peace, joy, and flow
- patterns in the noise
- accessibility
- constraints that are supportive instead of deformative
- design for what we want to be
- constant improvement of the design

Some questions to ask yourselves before designing an experience:

- who are we, and why are we here?
- are we on the same page?
- are we emotionally committed?
- do we have resources?
- are we the right people to design this?
- is everyone here who should be here?
- what do we want to give, that people want to receive?
- what do we want people to feel, think, say?
- are we consulting with the intended users, or are we just engaging in speculative empathy?

A few questions to consider about your audience:

- can we make a list of everyone who touches our work? 
- who is missing? 
- how will we order the list?
- why are they here?
- what are their needs, motivations, feelings, values?
- where are the barriers?

Map out the flow of the experience. Consider the following:

- motivations
- barriers
- values
- desire paths
- loops
- choices
- points-of-joy
- interactions
- goals

Using this map and actual tests, check for any redundancies and inconsistencies.

Have a clearly defined aim for each test and experiment you conduct to refine the experience.
