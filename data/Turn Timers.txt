A game about intuitive decision-making (rather than calculation) provides the player with limited information and time. This sometimes make turn timers necessary.

In real-time games, the ever-changing scenario is an implicit, dynamic timer. Timers are generally accepted in multiplayer games. It is harder to justify timers to players in singleplayer, turn-based games.

When designing timers, make sure not to make it extrinsic (from the real world, as opposed to from the virtual game world). This can feel invasive.

Diegetic timers feel much more natural. Rhythm-themed games have their turn timers in the form of the beat and duration of the song. Side-scrolling games have their turn timers in the form of an advancing wall of death.

The game's design has to take turn timers into account from the beginning.
