Desirable Publisher Traits

Ideally, the publisher should put the developer and game front and center. 

Understand who does what and what the structure is at the publisher. Know who can make things happen and get stuff done. 

You should be able to contact the people responsible easily. 

Everyone involved must be able to talk transparently about anything that could impact any aspect of the game.

There's money and reputation at stake, so take it seriously. It is your responsibility to research the publisher's body of work and reputation.

Once you are talking seriously to a publisher, ask for references. Talk to developers that are already in the publisher's portfolio, not just the successful ones. How did the publisher deal with a game that wasn't performing well? 

When negotiating an agreement, do not settle for unclear answers, or assume anything.

Know the health of your publisher. Who funds the publisher? Who pays them? Understand risks and have a "Plan B".

Do not sell the IP. Do not make it part of any agreement. Are there any exclusivity clauses written in that would prevent you developing your IP elsewhere? How is the IP positioned, promoted and messaged by the publisher to the world? The IP isn't just the game. It's ANY other opportunity that comes out of the idea. Ownership is control.
