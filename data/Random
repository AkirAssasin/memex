Randomness doesn't always look good, because our brain tends to be more attracted to patterns. 

When randomness causes VFX to cluster together, it looks odd. Instead, you could randomly offset from a preset, well-distributed pattern. For example, looping between a few positions when spawning particles, or evenly distributing positions and angles before randomly offsetting.
