Make games that don’t just end with the completion of the main storyline. Implement modes such as New Game+ with varied challenges. Make sure the game allows for a multitude of different playstyles that correspond with different states of flow, and make sure that the player can always aspire to get better at the game by making the levels repeatable with different perks and rewards for doing so. For example, in both mobile and PC platforms, you can’t really go wrong with the 3-star rating system. Find ways to iterate on that basic retention mechanic and combine it with teasing character unlocks to keep player hooked for ages.
