touch controls for tactility
- have to be comfortable to use
- inspires confidence in the player
- game state is conveyed to the player as fast as possible
- controls intuitively convey their effect (like joystick)
- apple recommends 44x44 pts buttons, but you can make the hitbox larger for buttons that player can't see
- swipe down < swipe up because of ease of gesture
- controls should require fingers to move more than few centimetres or it will be harder to feel the gesture
- controls should not make players move very far because it will be hard to remember where the position of the finger is on
- audio should emulate physical effects
- controls should influence game design
- don't let players concentrate on controls, concentrate on the game
