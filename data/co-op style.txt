There are 4 different styles of co-op PvE scenarios.

The garage door only opens if 2 players lift the door. Once done, they have to push the car together.
THE GATE - the players don't have to collaborate with each other until a gate blocks both of them. The 'gate' is blocked until everyone is ready to continue.

The garage door can be opened by one player and the car can be pushed by one player.
THE COMFORT - the challenge is so hard that having more than one player is a necessity. Still, the game can be completed without communication, just by following the strongest player in the team.

The garage door can only be opened by a locksmith and the car can only be driven by a pilot.
THE CLASS - each player has a unique task that only they can do in order for everyone to succeed. Sometimes requires communication.

The garage door will close if a player doesnâ€™t keep it open and any player can push the car.
THE JOB - similar to THE CLASS, but players can trade 'jobs' at any time. However, one player is unable to complete them all at the same time.
