Heighten the tension in a boss fight by making it as much a battle of wits as of brawn. 

Give the player a clear and justifiable reason to take down the boss. 

Keep your boss fight designs consistent with the game's underlying themes and mechanics.

A boss fight is a story within the larger story of the game, and as such it should have beats that build anticipation and charge emotions.

Have clear visual feedback that not only shows the effects of a player's actions but also provides clues as to where the enemies' weaknesses lie. 

Boss fights present conflict between characters, and that conflict need not necessarily be violent if it's about developing relationships or empathy or furthering a story beat.
