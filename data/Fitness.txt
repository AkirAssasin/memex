Decisions about how a procedural generator should work often end up involving a difficult balancing-act between two important needs: variety and quality.

A Fitness Function allows you to achieve both, and it lets you focus on the two problems independently.

1. Make some examples of your content by hand
2. Try to capture the most important steps in your process
3. Convert your approximated-process into code

4. Explore lots of examples made by your new generator
5. Write a function that measures the quality of a generated asset
6. When you generate content for a player, generate a bunch of examples, measure their fitness values, and pick one of the highest-scoring results
