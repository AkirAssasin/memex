To make players care about something like the story or atmosphere, tie it to an important mechanic like their health.

Don't scale up numbers if everything has to scale evenly in the end - just keep them all as low as possible.

When you have interplay between multiple important mechanics, it empowers interesting decision-making. Side objectives helps to widen the available priorities.
