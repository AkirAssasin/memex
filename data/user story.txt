A User Story/Journey is a non-technical description of how a player would interact with an element of a game, focusing on their experience and emotions. These help you describe why a game would need a certain element.

Here's a template for a user story:

1. Informing
How will the player find out about the new features?

- brief text hints or patch release notes
- in-game notifications and markers
- provide a testing chamber or playground to test it out
- new quests to obtain the feature
- putting new features at the top of menus or shops
etc. 

2. Clarifying
How will the player understand how to use it?

- new gameplay mode devoted to that feature
- watching other players using it
etc.

3. Feedback
How to help players use it?

- distinct icons and appearance
- visual confirmation and warnings
- effective plays and counterplays
- the feature itself is not frustrating to use
etc.
