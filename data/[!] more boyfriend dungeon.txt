What Worked in Boyfriend Dungeon's Kickstarter

Time limited tiers: 
Using 'limited in time' option for early bird tiers instead of 'limited in quantities' increases the likelihood of Day 1 pledges and cause a snowball effect.

Hidden stretch goals: 
Revealing them one by one gives time to think about the costs, their scope, last minute changes, and something newsworthy to announce everytime they were revealed.

Fun stretch goals: 
Not everything needs to be about virality, it’s worthwhile to acknowledge the community that got you there. Numbers can mean nothing if you don’t have positive word of mouth or an engaged community to do anything about it.

Previous Kickstarter experience, shipped games, and studio legitimacy were a HUGE plus.

A Backer-only Discord makes the community feel much more intimate and dedicated.

Newsletters, but they were love letters.

No “$1” pledge tier. A $1 tier could have caused an anchoring effect for those that saw it first, making pledges smaller or making them less willing to spend money at a higher tier. You can always pledge at $1 if you really wanted anyway.
