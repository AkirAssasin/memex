Untitled Goose Game has 2 versions of Debussy’s “Prelude No. 12: Minstrels.” To make the BGM situational-aware, composer Dan Golding recorded two versions of the “Prelude”: one played normally, and one with a much lower, softer energy. 

The tracks were then split up at every two beats. To avoid sounding chopped up, Golding made sure that the reverb rings out as much as it can after the two beats. When played over each other, it just sounds like the piano is holding down the sustain pedal.

The game then chooses which version to play depending on what’s happening in the game.
