That slight edge you get from being “a Devolver game” or “an Atlus game” can be a big boon, and help set you up for future success. Publishers often have a lot more sway than your average indie when it comes to getting dev kits.

Unless you get lucky with one of the big publishers, you need to look further. New publishers and platforms are cropping up all the time. Check in with fellow struggling indies. They may know of publishers you don’t. If you’re asking people for info, share and share alike. Use any lists or groups you may be a part of. Ask others about the publisher’s reputation. 

Treat the pitch like you’re making a children’s book. Big photos with one or two big bullet points per page. Easy to understand means easy to pitch. Bring pitch documents and builds with you just in case the opportunity to show your games arises. 

Have backups for your backups for your backups. Publishers can change their business plans on a dime. 

You can’t count on getting money fast, that is a rarity.

If you’re always pitching, always talking to folks, you’ve got to check in with the people you’ve sent stuff to. Sometimes people don’t get back to you without a poke! Nobody is going to come to you to tell you important stuff. 

Do be transparent that you’re pitching multiple companies, but don’t pretend one company is about to sign you unless they really are.

Figure out who can actually help you, and how. Most publishers won’t be able to do all things at once, so figure out what’s important to you.
